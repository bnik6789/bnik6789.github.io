# Card Tricks Game

This is a basic incremental game I have made in my free time. I started this project to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this game is to shuffle a deck of cards every possible way (52!).

Becuase of the nature of an incremental game, this project is has multiple phases I am working on. 

## Phase 1 (Complete) - Basic Card Magic 
- Basic clicker mechanic, (Gain one card per click, for every 12 cards gain a Card Magic Knowledge Point (CMKP))
- Can learn Magic Tricks, some Magic Tricks have prequisites (Fundamentals) to buy first, and can learn different Shuffling Techniques, each cost a certain CMKP and can only buy a specific amount. 
- Can Perform Magic Tricks for an audience gain money. Each Performance costs a certain amount of Magic Tricks and has a cooldown feature that increases after every Performance
- Can buy/hire Auto Shufflers with money gained from performances to automate card shuffling. Must wait (t<=30sec) to Aquire the shuffled cards from Auto Shufflers
- Can buy more decks for Personal Clicker and Auto Shufflers to shuffle more cards.

## Phase 2 (In Progress) - Automated Era
- Can buy more Auto Shufflers.
- Can Perform for larger audiences to gain more money.
- Will add more Magic Tricks, preresiquites (Funadmental), and Suffling Techniques.
- Extra Deck Upgrades will include Shuffling Techniques for Auto Shufflers that will increase decks per second.

## Phase 3 - Computer Takeover
- Will start to rely on Automated Computers to quicken deck shuffling
## Phase 4 - End Game
